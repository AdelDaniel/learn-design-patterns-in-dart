# Bridge Structural Design Pattern
Also known as:  `Handle / Body`

  - is a Structural Design Pattern.
  - that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
  ---
  + Intention: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
