## **What Problem Facade Solve**

- Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework.
- Ordinarily, youâ€™d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, **`execute methods in the correct order`**, and so on.

> As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the implementation details of 3rd-party classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain.

### Solution 
- A facade is a `class` that provides a `simple interface` to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts.
- A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly.
- However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.

- Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.
