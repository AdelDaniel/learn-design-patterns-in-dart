# Strategy Behavioral Design Pattern

- Strategy is a
  - behavioral design pattern 
  - that lets you define a family of algorithms,
  - put each of them into a separate class,
  - and make their objects interchangeable.

## Components && Diagrams (UML class || Sequence diagrams).

### Components By Guru

<img style="background-color:#554777" src = "assets/structure_pattern_guru.png">

#### 1. Context:
   - maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies and
   - communicates with this object only via the strategy interface.

#### 2. Strategy interface:
   - is common to all concrete strategies. 
   - It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.

#### 3. Concrete Strategies:
   - implement different variations of an algorithm the context uses.

#### 4. Client: 
   - creates a specific strategy object and passes it to the context.
   - The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.

**The context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesnâ€™t know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.**

---

### Components By geeksforgeeks

#### 1. Context
- A class or object known as the Context 
  - assigns the task to a strategy object 
  - and contains a reference to it.
- **The Context holds a reference to the selected strategy and delegates the task to it.**

- <details>
  <summary> <p style="display: inline;">More Details</p> </summary>

  - It serves as an intermediary between the client and the strategy,
  - offering an integrated approach for task execution without exposing every detail of the process.
  - The Context maintains a reference to a strategy object and calls its methods to perform the task, allowing for interchangeable strategies to be used.
  
  </details>


#### 2. Strategy Interface
- An abstract class or interface known as the Strategy Interface
  -  specifies a set of methods that all concrete strategies must implement.
- The Strategy Interface serves as a contract that defines a set of methods that all concrete strategies must implement.


- <details>
  <summary> <p style="display: inline;">More Details</p> </summary>

  - As a kind of agreement, it guarantees that all strategies follow the same set of rules and are interchangeable by the Context.
  - The Strategy Interface promotes flexibility and modularity in the design by establishing a common interface that enables decoupling between the Context and the specific strategies.
  </details>


#### 3. Concrete Strategies
- Concrete Strategies are the various implementations of the Strategy Interface.
- Each concrete strategy provides a specific algorithm or behavior for performing the task defined by the Strategy Interface.

- <details>
  <summary> <p style="display: inline;">More Details</p> </summary>

  - Concrete strategies encapsulate the details of their respective algorithms and provide a method for executing the task.
  - They are interchangeable and can be selected and configured by the client based on the requirements of the task.
  </details>


#### 4. Client
- The Client is responsible for 
  - selecting and configuring the appropriate strategy 
  - and providing it to the Context.
- **The Client selects an appropriate strategy based on the task requirements and provides it to the Context**

- <details>
  <summary> <p style="display: inline;">More Details</p> </summary>
    
  - It knows the requirements of the task and decides which strategy to use based on those requirements.
  - The client creates an instance of the desired concrete strategy and passes it to the Context,
  - enabling the Context to use the selected strategy to perform the task.
  </details>


## What problems can it solve || When to Use || Use Cases


### The Strategy Design Pattern can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

- Sorting algorithms:
  - Different sorting algorithms can be encapsulated into separate strategies and passed to an object that needs sorting.
- Validation rules: 
  - Different validation rules can be encapsulated into separate strategies and passed to an object that needs validation.
- Text formatting: 
  - Different formatting strategies can be encapsulated into separate strategies and passed to an object that needs formatting.
- Database access: 
  - Different database access strategies can be encapsulated into separate strategies and passed to an object that needs to access data from different sources.
- Payment strategy: 
  - Different payment methods can be encapsulated into separate strategies and passed to an object that needs to process payments.


 <details>
    <summary> <h3 style="display: inline;">geeksforgeeks</h3> </summary>

- **Multiple Algorithms**: 
  - When you have multiple algorithms that can be used interchangeably based on different contexts, such as sorting algorithms
- **Encapsulating Algorithms**: 
  - When you want to encapsulate the implementation details of algorithms separately from the context that uses them,
- **Runtime Selection**: 
  - When you need to dynamically select and switch between different algorithms at runtime based on user preferences, configuration settings.
- **Reducing Conditional Statements**: 
  - When you have a class with multiple conditional statements that choose between different behaviors.
- **Open and Closed**: 
  - the Strategy pattern makes it easier to extend the system with new algorithms without modifying existing code.

 <details>
    <summary> <h3 style="display: inline;">refactoring.guru</h3> </summary>

- When you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
- When you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
- Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.
- When your class has a massive conditional statement that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.

## Examples 

### Operations with context Example 
Source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/strategy_pattern.htm

<img style="background-color:#554777" src = "assets/strategy_pattern_uml_diagram.jpg">

  - Context is a class which uses a Strategy.
  - In Main will use Context and strategy objects to demonstrate change in Context behavior based on strategy it deploys or uses.


```dart
/// 
/// Step 1: Create an interface.
abstract interface class Strategy {
  int doOperation(int num1, int num2);
}

/// 
/// Step 2: Create concrete classes implementing the same interface.

/// OperationAdd
class OperationAdd implements Strategy {
  @override
  int doOperation(int num1, int num2) => num1 + num2;
}

/// OperationSubtract
class OperationSubtract implements Strategy {
  @override
  int doOperation(int num1, int num2) => num1 - num2;
}

/// OperationMultiply
class OperationMultiply implements Strategy {
  @override
  int doOperation(int num1, int num2) => num1 * num2;
}

///
/// Step 3: Create Context Class.
class Context {
  final Strategy _strategy;

  Context(Strategy strategy) : this._strategy = strategy;

  int executeStrategy(int num1, int num2) {
    return _strategy.doOperation(num1, num2);
  }
}

/// 
/// Step 4: Use the Context to see change in behavior when it changes its Strategy.
void main() {
  Context context = Context(OperationAdd());
  print("10 + 5 = " + "${context.executeStrategy(10, 5)}");

  context = Context(OperationSubtract());
  print("10 - 5 = " + "${context.executeStrategy(10, 5)}");

  context = Context(OperationMultiply());
  pri
}

```
### Sorting Example

<img style="background-color:#554777" src = "assets/geeks_strategy_dp.png">

```dart
abstract interface class SortStrategy {
  List<int> sort(List<int> list);
}

class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
  @override
  List<int> sort(List<int> list) {
    for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < list.length - i - 1; j++) {
        if (list[j] > list[j + 1]) {
          int temp = list[j];
          list[j] = list[j + 1];
          list[j + 1] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
    return list;
  }
}

class SelectionSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
  @override
  List<int> sort(List<int> list) {
    for (int i = 0; i < list.length - 1; i++) {
      int minIndex = i;
      for (int j = i + 1; j < list.length; j++) {
        if (list[j] < list[minIndex]) {
          minIndex = j;
        }
      }
      int temp = list[minIndex];
      list[minIndex] = list[i];
      list[i] = temp;
    }
    return list;
  }
}

class SortContext {
  SortStrategy _sortStrategy;

  SortContext(SortStrategy sortStrategy) : _sortStrategy = sortStrategy;

  void changeStrategy(SortStrategy sortStrategy) =>
      _sortStrategy = sortStrategy;

  List<int> sort(List<int> list) {
    return _sortStrategy.sort(list);
  }
}

void main() {
  // Create SortContext with BubbleSortStrategy
  SortContext sortContext = SortContext(BubbleSortStrategy());
  List<int> list1 = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5];
  sortContext.sort(list1);

  // Change strategy to MergeSortStrategy
  sortContext.changeStrategy(SelectionSortStrategy());
  List<int> list2 = [8, 3, 7, 4, 2];
  sortContext.sort(list2);
}

```

## Summery

- The Strategy Design Pattern is a powerful pattern in the world of object-oriented programming. 
- It provides a flexible way to encapsulate and swap the behavior of an object at runtime,
- enabling code to be more adaptable and easier to maintain.
