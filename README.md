## **Design Patterns** 
> reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

- It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.
    -  Rather, it is a *description* or *template*
    - for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

- Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

- Object-oriented design patterns 
    1. show relationships and interactions
    1. between classes or objects,
    1. without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved.

 >   Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages.
     Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.

## **Creational Design Pattern**

- **Wikipedia**
 
   - Are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.   
    - The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design.
    - Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
    - Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas.
    - One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
    - Another is hiding how instances of these  concrete classes are created and combined

-  **Tutorial point**

     - a way to create objects.
     - while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator.         
     - This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

## **Structural Design Pattern**

- **Wikipedia**
    - Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
    - Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose
    interfaces or implementations.
        - As a simple example, consider how multiple
        inheritance mixes two or more chasses into one. The result is a class that 3 combines the properties of its parent chasses.
    <!-- - This pattern is particularly useful for making iridependently developed class libraries work together. 
        - Another example is the class form of the Adapter pattern. In general, an adapter makes |one interface (the adaptee's) conform to another, thereby providing a uniform abstraction of different interfaces.A class adapter accomplishes this by 1 inheriting privately from an adaptee class. The adapter then expresses its | interface in terms of the adapteeâ€™s. | -->

- **tutorial point**
    - These design patterns concern class and object composition.
    - Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
